# SMART DECISION MAKING SYSTEM – Smart Soil Testing IoT

This project presents an IoT-based Smart Decision Making System for real-time soil monitoring
and agricultural decision support. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller interfaced with soil
and environmental sensors to measure parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrients.

Sensor data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to cloud platforms including Blynk IoT and Google Sheets
for real-time monitoring and historical data logging. A custom Android application and a web
dashboard provide user-friendly visualization and alerts to support smart irrigation and
precision farming decisions.
